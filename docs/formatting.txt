# GENERAL FORMATTING GUIDELINES OBEYED BY ALL

1) Four spaces, not tabs; never, EVER, tabs.

2) Methods:

    names: camelCase
    example:

    /**
    * // optional explanation goes here.
    * @param variableOne is variable one.
    * @param variableTwo is variable two.
    **/
    public void newMethod(int variableOne, Boolean variableTwo) {
        // code goes here.

    }

    main points: there is a space between the ) and { at the end of the declaration.
                 there is ALWAYS a return at the end of the declaration.
                 the docstring goes ABOVE the method, and the name of the method should tell you everything you need
                 to know about what it does. If you need to provide an explanation do it in 10 words or less.
                 in line comments should go beside the thing being explained. For example:

                    Boolean x = 0; // I need this because I'm a bad programmer.

3) Classes:

    example:

    /**
    * // Explain what the class IS not what it DOES. You explain what it does in the constructors and methods.
    **/
    public class NewClass {
        int varOne;
        Boolean varTwo;

        public void main(String[] args) {
        }

        /**
        * // optional explanation.
        * @param setVarOne sets varOne.
        * @param setVarTwo sets varTwo.
        **/
        public int NewClass(int setVarOne, Boolean setVarTwo) {
            // Do stuff, no space at the top.

            return 0;
        }
     <- note this return.
    }

    main points: Note this extra return on the trailing close? It's important, always add an extra return. Then, you'll
                 find it a lot easier to dig yourself out of a mis-matched brace '{' issue.
                 Note the single blank line between the methods.
                 Note there is NO space between the class declaration and the instance vars.
                 Always put a blank line BEFORE a return statement, never AFTER.
                 Do NOT document the main function. UNLESS it does something unrelated to testing. The only time this
                 will be the case (in our project) is the main loop / initial frame. Otherwise, NONE of the classes
                 need main functions. Also, main functions always go at the top.
                 Again, method docstrings tell a programmer what a method DOES not how it works. If you need to
                 explain how a method works, you're writing shit code and should try again. How a method WORKS should
                 be obvious to anyone that can write code.

 Basically, just use the skeletons already set up for the class to model your classes. The only thing I (Josh) care about
 is the spaces between the ) and { and the { must always be on the same line as the declaration.

 Things people get bitchy about:

 1) Lines longer than 120 chars. Keep your statements shorter than this, or carry them over. For example:

    if ( this == that
    && this + that = this&that
    || this // that = nothing) {
        //do something
    }

    just make sure you put the main operators at the beginning of each line (in this case the && and || operators.)

2) Overly nested loops. If you're going 3 or 4 layers deep, make sure you're not making life too hard for yourself.

3) Explicit overrides of builtins should use the _overrideName convention (put a _ before the declaration so it
doesn't actually mess with the builtin.)

4) Coordinates should always be expressed as a lowercase x or lowercase y. For example:

    xWidth
    yWidth

    xLocation
    yLocation

    xMove
    yMove

    I'm sure you get it.
